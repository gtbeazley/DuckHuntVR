Review of George-Thomas Beazleys Duck Hunt VR
By: Martin Kocourek

T) Aim (Move the mouse) at the quit button and shoot (Press the left mouse button)
E) This should quit the game successfully
O) Works mostly as expected, but aiming is offset.

T) Do the same with the start game button
E) This change the game map to the main game 
O) Works as expected.

T) Aim the cursor at the ducks(red balls) and shoot 
E) No bullets(Displayed on the bottom left) should be lost, 
the duck should respawn at their spawn point, and a point should be added to the players score(Displayed on the bottom right)
O) Functions as expected.

T) Miss the duck
E) A bullet should be lost
O) Works as expected.

T) Miss three times
E) This should take you back to the main menu screen and show a new highscore(If you set a new one)
O) Functions as expected.

T) Play the game as many times as needed to answer these questions

Q) Were there any expectations in the tests that weren't meant?
A) All tests are achievable with expected results.

Q) Are there any issues with the game
A) Aiming on the menu screen behaves somewhat strangely; I need to aim ~45 degrees downward, causing the Quit button to appear near the top of the screen, to have the Quit button highlighted.

Q) What was your highest score
A) 46.

Q) Is there any other notes worth noting
A) Targets respawning at their original positions instead of having random spawn points means that it's easy to spawn-camp them for very high scores.

[After Feedback Notes]
-After realising how easy it was to spawn kill, a fix was implemented to spawn the ducks at a different spot
-After reading the response about the main menu, a solution has been used to solve the offset aim issue
